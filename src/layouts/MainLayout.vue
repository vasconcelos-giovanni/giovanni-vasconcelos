      Witchcraft, as most commonly understood in both historical and present-day communities, is the
      use of alleged supernatural powers of magic, generally stereotyped[1][need quotation to
      verify] as doing harm or evil.[2] A practitioner of witchcraft is a witch (predominantly for
      women), though men may sometimes be referred to as a warlock. The belief in witchcraft has
      been found in a great number of societies worldwide. Anthropologists have applied the English
      term "witchcraft" to similar and related beliefs in occult practices in many different
      cultures, and societies that have adopted the English language have often internalised the
      term.[3][4][5] In medieval and early modern Europe, where belief in witchcraft traces back to
      classical antiquity, accused witches were usually women who were believed to have used
      maleficium or black magic against their own community, and often to have communed with evil
      beings. It was thought witchcraft could be thwarted by protective magic or counter-magic,
      which could be provided by cunning folk or folk healers. Suspected witches were also
      intimidated, banished, attacked or killed. Often they would be formally prosecuted and
      punished, if found guilty or simply believed to be guilty. European witch-hunts and witch
      trials in the early modern period led to tens of thousands of executions. In some regions,
      many of those accused of witchcraft were cunning folk,[6] folk healers or midwives.[7][8][9]
      European belief in witchcraft gradually dwindled during and after the Age of Enlightenment. As
      with the cunning-folk in Europe, Indigenous communities that believe in the existence of
      witchcraft define witches as the opposite of their healers and medicine people, and the latter
      are sought out for protection against witchcraft.[10][11][12] Modern witch-hunting takes place
      in parts of Africa and Asia. In contemporary Western culture, adherents of some neo-pagan
      religions, most notably Wicca, as well as some followers of New Age belief systems, may
      self-identify as "witches", and use the term "witchcraft" for their self-help, healing, or
      divination rituals.[13][10][14][15][excessive citations] Other neo-pagans avoid the term due
      to its negative connotations.[16]
